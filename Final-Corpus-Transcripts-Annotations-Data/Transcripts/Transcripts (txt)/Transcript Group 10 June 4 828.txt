10.Orange.52	03:22.8	03:26.8	"Yeah, and then we are left with flashlight and rope."

10.Orange.53	03:28.6	03:29.2	"Okay."
10.Pink.49	03:29.2	03:42.2	"It's weird cause I usually think that would be higher up considering it's rope and like light but I, uh, mean we are left with kind of twelve and thirteen so."
10.Orange.54	03:31.7	03:32.3	"Mhm."
