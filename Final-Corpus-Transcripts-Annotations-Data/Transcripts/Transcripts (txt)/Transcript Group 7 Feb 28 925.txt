7.Green.5	00:19.0	00:21.2	"So I put that one as like my third one."
7.Green.6	00:21.2	00:23.6	"Just because like a compress kit --"
7.Blue.3	00:21.2	00:21.9	"Okay."

7.Green.12	00:55.3	00:56.5	"Okay I thought that too."
7.Green.13	00:56.5	01:13.2	"But like if you have a lighter and then it kind of like sparks and stuff with just like the flint in it, I feel like you're clever enough, which I'm not, I'm just thinking I'm just I don't know, some crazy engineer person, could take it apart and like take that out and kinda like start a fire with it."

7.Green.75	04:52.6	04:54.4	"Okay no I just had an idea."
7.Green.76	04:54.4	05:14.4	"So think of it like, if you put the shortening in with the steel wool, it could make like I think a candle or like even the rope, you like you take some of the rope and cut it with the knife and you put a little bit of shortening on it and then try and light that, it is kind of like a candle."

7.Blue.37	05:23.3	05:25.2	"$"
7.Blue.38	05:25.9	05:31.6	"See my thought is that like you can combine like the newspaper, the ball of steel wool, and the cigarette lighter somehow to make it like go on fire."
7.Blue.39	05:31.6	05:32.7	"But I wouldn't know how."
7.Green.79	05:32.2	05:33.0	"Okay."

7.Green.84	05:53.0	05:54.7	"Yeah, I put the whiskey, too."
7.Blue.44	05:54.7	05:58.6	"I thought that like when I left it to the end, I was like it probably has another use."
7.Blue.45	05:58.6	06:03.4	"But then I was like if you put it with like the compress kit cause like people use alcohol to like sanitize."
7.Green.85	06:02.0	06:03.4	"Sanitize, yeah."
7.Orange.46	06:03.6	06:06.2	"Or just start a fire maybe."
7.Blue.46	06:05.9	06:06.5	"Oh."
7.Green.86	06:06.0	06:08.0	"I could see that, too, yeah."

7.Green.97	06:45.9	06:54.7	"I know when we're talking about everything like I feel like it would kind of helpful now like cause some stuff in a way."

7.Orange.62	07:35.8	07:37.9	"But like you'd have to like cut a holes in the ice."
7.Blue.56	07:37.6	07:39.8	"No, you could use the ski poll for that maybe."
7.Blue.57	07:39.8	07:46.9	"Like as a fishing and then with like the steel wool as like the thing that goes on the ski poll to fish."
7.Orange.63	07:40.0	07:40.8	"Maybe."
7.Green.108	07:41.3	07:42.5	"Chip at it."
7.Green.109	07:46.6	07:47.8	"Okay."
7.Blue.58	07:46.9	07:48.2	"If that makes sense."
7.Orange.64	07:47.8	07:48.9	"Or the ro -- yeah."
7.Green.110	07:49.0	07:50.0	"I can see that."
7.Orange.65	07:49.1	07:49.6	"Yeah."
7.Orange.66	07:49.8	07:50.5	"Yeah maybe."
7.Green.111	07:52.9	07:54.6	"Um."
7.Orange.67	07:55.4	07:57.4	"Should we just try to like write it down?"
7.Green.112	07:57.4	07:57.9	"Yeah."
7.Orange.68	07:57.8	07:59.5	"Like agree on like one."
7.Green.113	07:59.4	08:00.6	"Okay, so."
7.Green.114	08:02.2	08:05.1	"So, well, I feel like you guys have the same answer for number one."
7.Green.115	08:05.1	08:06.5	"Or do we all have different ones?"
7.Blue.59	08:06.7	08:08.3	"I think we all have different ones for one."
7.Orange.69	08:07.8	08:08.7	"Yeah for number one."
7.Orange.70	08:08.7	08:10.7	"Cause you said compress kit, right?"
7.Blue.60	08:10.4	08:11.1	"Yeah."
7.Orange.71	08:10.9	08:12.5	"Yeah, I said the clothes."
7.Orange.72	08:12.5	08:13.0	"And then."
7.Green.116	08:12.7	08:14.0	"And I said compass."
7.Blue.61	08:15.8	08:18.5	"Honestly, maybe clothes, so then they stay warm."
7.Green.117	08:17.0	08:19.0	"Yeah I think the clothes."
7.Orange.73	08:18.2	08:20.4	"Yeah I think clothes."
7.Green.118	08:22.3	08:23.3	"Okay."
7.Green.119	08:23.6	08:24.4	"Two."
7.Green.120	08:26.0	08:27.1	"Um."
7.Green.121	08:29.8	08:30.8	"I miss --"
7.Blue.62	08:31.8	08:37.9	"I kinda wanna say compress kit in case they're like injured at all cause that could like cause them to like die out faster."
7.Green.122	08:37.9	08:39.4	"Yeah, that's true."
7.Orange.74	08:38.6	08:39.8	"Yeah, true."
7.Green.123	08:39.9	08:41.0	"We'll do that two."
7.Orange.75	08:41.0	08:41.7	"Yeah."
7.Green.124	08:41.7	08:42.9	"Let's just do two."

7.Green.126	08:45.6	08:47.3	"Um, three?"
7.Orange.76	08:48.0	08:49.4	"Maybe the compass?"
7.Green.127	08:49.7	08:51.1	"Yeah yeah."
7.Green.128	08:51.3	08:52.5	"I feel like that's important."
7.Green.129	08:52.5	08:54.6	"I don't think you want to go away from --"
7.Blue.63	08:55.1	08:58.7	"Um, maybe the map after the compass so you can guide yourself on it?"
7.Green.130	08:58.9	09:02.2	"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah."
7.Orange.77	08:59.1	09:00.1	"Yeah."
7.Green.131	09:03.0	09:04.5	"Cause I don't think you want to keep heading north."
7.Green.132	09:04.5	09:07.7	"Cause I think eventually if you head -- keep heading south, you will hit a town."
7.Green.133	09:07.7	09:08.8	"We're in Canada."
7.Green.134	09:08.8	09:10.8	"Since everyone's near the border."

7.Green.141	09:25.0	09:25.7	"Yeah."
7.Green.142	09:26.6	09:29.5	"Yeah, cause I feel like that's more functional than most things."
7.Blue.65	09:29.7	09:31.9	"Or would you need the flashlight first?"
7.Orange.79	09:31.5	09:34.1	"Yeah, I was gonna say either knife or flashlight."

7.Green.147	09:45.6	09:46.6	"Um."
7.Green.148	09:47.1	09:52.2	"And I feel like some kind of food wise we would -- like either the chocolate bar or the shortening."
7.Blue.66	09:52.6	09:55.4	"But the shortening is only one can for all the people."
7.Orange.80	09:56.2	09:58.4	"Yeah, so maybe just the chocolate bar?"
7.Green.149	09:56.3	09:57.1	"True."

7.Blue.70	10:33.2	10:35.0	"Like if a bear attacks or something."
7.Green.158	10:35.0	10:35.6	"Yeah."
7.Blue.71	10:35.6	10:37.5	"You could also eat that after."
7.Green.159	10:36.8	10:37.8	"Yeah, true."
7.Orange.83	10:37.6	10:38.8	"Yeah."
7.Green.160	10:37.8	10:39.1	"Okay, it's functional."
